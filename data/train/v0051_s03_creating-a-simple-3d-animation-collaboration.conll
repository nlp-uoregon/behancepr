alt	O
r	COMMA
which	O
supposedly	O
removes	O
everything	PERIOD
all	O
my	O
rotations	PERIOD
oops	EXCLAMATION
no	COMMA
or	O

ok	PERIOD
all	O
right	PERIOD
so	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
clear	O
this	O

000	PERIOD
alright	COMMA
sweet	PERIOD

we	O
want	O
this	O
to	O
be	O
180	COMMA
I	O

negative	O
180	PERIOD
oh	COMMA
fudge	O
nugget	EXCLAMATION
one	O
of	O
my	O
touching	QUESTION
is	O

parenting	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
would	QUESTION
it	O
should	O
be	PERIOD
alright	EXCLAMATION
so	O
I'm	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
here	PERIOD
and	O
then	COMMA
we	O
should	O
see	O
the	O
camera	O

yeah	EXCLAMATION
so	COMMA
we're	O
seeing	O
the	O
camera	O

one	PERIOD
I	O
was	O
doing	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
just	O

it's	O
negative	O
62.2	COMMA
which	O
obviously	COMMA
is	O
not	O
right	O
from	O
a	O
mathematical	O

but	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
that	O
is	COMMA
because	O
there	O
must've	O
been	O
some	O
adjustments	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
