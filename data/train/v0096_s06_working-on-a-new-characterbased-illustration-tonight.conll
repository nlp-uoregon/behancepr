ok	PERIOD
I	O
think	O
I	O
just	O
need	O
to	O
get	O
off	O
this	O
tool	PERIOD
there	O
we	O
go	EXCLAMATION
alright	PERIOD
so	COMMA
just	O
like	O
that	COMMA
I	O
got	O
a	O
mirrored	O
version	O
of	O
my	O
artwork	PERIOD
it	O
is	O
one	PERIOD
let's	O
see	O
what	O
the	O
layers	O
look	O
like	COMMA
now	O
that	O
it's	O
created	O
that	O
mirror	PERIOD
so	COMMA
I	O
have	O
a	O
group	PERIOD
an	O
inside	O
of	O
that	O
group	COMMA
I	O
have	O
the	O
individual	COMMA
looks	O
like	O
I	O
have	O
some	COMMA
some	O
errant	O
shapes	O
inherently	PERIOD
you	O
don't	O
need	O
him	PERIOD
so	COMMA
it	O
created	COMMA
it	O
grouped	O
those	O
teardrops	PERIOD
it	O
didn't	O
group	O
the	O
lightning	O
bolt	O
eyebrows	PERIOD
but	COMMA
that's	O
cool	PERIOD
uh	COMMA
what	O
else	QUESTION
it	O
grouped	O
together	PERIOD
oh	EXCLAMATION
it	COMMA
into	O
one	O
path	O
that	O
combines	O
those	O
two	O
separate	O
shapes	PERIOD
the	O
eyes	COMMA
it	O
grouped	PERIOD
and	O
then	COMMA
the	O
head	COMMA
it	O
turned	O
into	O
one	O
path	PERIOD
so	COMMA
that	O
is	O
super	COMMA
super	O
awesome	EXCLAMATION
just	O
quickly	COMMA
the	O
other	O
thing	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
try	COMMA
now	O
that	O
we've	O
seen	O
that	O
work	O
is	COMMA
let's	O
lock	O
this	O
and	O
turn	O
the	O
layer	O
off	PERIOD
let's	O
start	O
a	O
layer	O
off	COMMA
by	O
turning	O
on	O
symmetry	COMMA
and	O
just	O
see	COMMA
just	O
see	O
how	O
that	O
works	PERIOD
so	COMMA
i'll	O
select	O
symmetry	PERIOD
looks	O
like	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
still	O
tell	O
it	COMMA
where	O
I	O
want	O
that	O
access	O
to	O
be	PERIOD
will	O
say	O
applied	O
a	O
layer	PERIOD
and	O
now	COMMA
let's	O
try	O
straight	O
drying	COMMA
and	O
see	O
what	O
happens	PERIOD
so	COMMA
I	O
gotta	O
remember	O
which	O
side	O
I	O
first	O
started	O
the	O
symmetry	O
on	PERIOD
so	COMMA
this	O
time	COMMA
instead	O
of	O
starting	O
on	O
the	O
left	O
side	COMMA
I	O
think	O
I	O
started	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
side	PERIOD
so	COMMA
start	O
drawing	O
this	O
eyebrow	PERIOD
and	O
that's	O
kind	O
of	O
cool	EXCLAMATION
you	O
can	O
see	O
now	COMMA
with	O
this	O
mirror	O
me	O
plug	O
in	PERIOD
applied	O
to	O
the	O
layer	PERIOD
now	COMMA
I'm	O
actually	O
drawing	O
with	O
symmetry	PERIOD
so	O
that	COMMA
is	O
awesome	PERIOD
I	O
am	O
very	O
psyched	O
about	O
this	PERIOD
let	O
me	O
drop	O
this	O
down	COMMA
I'm	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
say	O
if	O
this	O
works	COMMA
so	O
that	O
I	O
don't	O
crash	O
and	O
lose	O
it	PERIOD
ok	COMMA
so	O
the	O
other	O
thing	O
just	O
as	O
an	O
example	COMMA
now	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
that	COMMA
that	O
head	O
shape	O
created	PERIOD
I'm	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
turn	O
it	O
off	O
this	O
layer	COMMA
'cause	O
we	O
don't	O
have	O
the	O
usual	O
amount	O
of	O
symmetry	O
I	O
would	O
normally	O
have	PERIOD
so	O
just	O
turn	O
that	O
of	COMMA
going	O
to	O
turn	O
my	O
outline	O
back	O
on	PERIOD
and	COMMA
unlock	O
it	PERIOD
and	O
actually	O
will	O
make	O
a	O
copy	PERIOD
and	O
just	O
hide	O
the	O
original	PERIOD
and	O
let's	O
turn	O
the	O
sketch	O
off	PERIOD
and	O
just	O
play	O
with	O
this	O
symmetry	O
plug	O
in	COMMA
for	O
a	O
second	PERIOD
so	O
we	O
got	O
this	O
like	O
weird	O
little	O
character	PERIOD
i'll	O
make	O
him	O
a	O
little	O
smaller	PERIOD
let's	O
say	COMMA
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
use	O
him	O
as	O
the	O
basis	O
for	O
a	O
mandala	PERIOD
I	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
now	O
how	O
this	O
plugin	O
works	PERIOD
so	COMMA
if	O
I	O
say	COMMA
the	O
number	O
of	O
axes	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
pen	COMMA
and	O
I	O
choose	O
this	O
symmetry	O
tool	O
again	COMMA
it	O
starts	O
to	O
apply	O
symmetry	COMMA
based	O
on	O
where	COMMA
where	O
I'm	O
clicking	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
this	O
character	PERIOD
so	O
the	O
closer	O
I	O
am	O
to	O
the	O
character	COMMA
the	O
smaller	O
the	O
images	PERIOD
if	O
I	O
start	O
to	O
drag	O
up	COMMA
it's	O
starting	O
to	O
mirror	O
that	O
outwards	PERIOD
which	O
is	O
amazing	PERIOD
all	O
right	PERIOD
click	O
that	COMMA
and	O
say	O
apply	O
to	O
selection	PERIOD
and	O
then	COMMA
let's	O
just	O
grab	O
this	O
tool	PERIOD
ok	COMMA
ok	PERIOD
now	COMMA
now	O
we're	O
doing	O
something	PERIOD
this	O
is	O
amazing	PERIOD
so	O
just	O
like	O
that	COMMA
with	O
this	O
symmetry	O
tool	O
with	O
the	O
mirror	O
me	O
plugin	O
from	O
stu	O
graphics	COMMA
i've	O
got	O
this	O
little	O
weird	O
character	O
head	PERIOD
duplicated	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
times	COMMA
all	O
around	O
an	O
axis	O
that	O
i've	O
defined	O
in	O
the	O
plug	O
in	PERIOD
so	COMMA
I	O
had	O
10	O
different	O
axes	O
in	O
this	COMMA
so	O
it	O
was	O
mirroring	O
along	O
each	O
of	O
those	COMMA
so	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
20	PERIOD
20	O
heads	O
here	PERIOD
but	O
if	O
you're	O
creating	O
a	O
mandala	O
piece	COMMA
like	O
oh	O
my	O
goodness	COMMA
this	O
would	O
save	O
you	O
so	O
much	O
time	EXCLAMATION
and	O
I	O
wish	O
I	O
had	O
known	O
about	O
this	O
sooner	PERIOD
regrets	PERIOD
but	COMMA
I	O
know	O
about	O
it	O
now	PERIOD
you	O
know	O
about	O
it	O
now	PERIOD
if	O
you	O
are	O
curious	O
about	O
astute	O
graphics	COMMA
I	O
would	O
drop	O
a	O
link	O
in	O
chat	PERIOD
for	O
this	O
plugin	PERIOD
i'll	O
do	O
that	O
right	O
now	PERIOD
ccgraphics.com/plugins/mirrorme	PERIOD
so	COMMA
I	O
hope	O
you	O
