do	O
the	O
clean	O
up	O
first	PERIOD
so	O
i'll	O

and	O
then	O
just	O
make	O
a	O
new	O
layer	COMMA
zoom	O
in	O
here	COMMA
and	O
this	O
ad	O
some	O
texture	O
to	O
her	O

think	O
we'll	O
do	O
that	O

around	O
him	O
work	O
on	O
a	O

here	PERIOD
probably	O
not	O
this	O
one	PERIOD
I	O
don't	O
know	O
if	O
we're	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
play	O
around	O
it	O
and	O
see	O
how	O
it	O
goes	COMMA
but	O
I	O
also	O
do	O
need	O
to	O
add	O
some	O
like	O
darker	O
tones	O
in	O
her	O
hair	PERIOD
I	O
don't	O
know	O
I	O
kind	O

here	COMMA
oh	COMMA

before	O
I	O
do	O
anything	O
else	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
add	O
my	O

check	O
layer	COMMA
so	O
that	COMMA

like	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
everything	COMMA
you	O
fill	O
it	O
with	O
white	O

uhm	COMMA
I	O

on	O
her	O

they	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
too	O
much	O
contrast	O
compared	O
to	O
her	O
skin	O
tone	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
might	COMMA
a	COMMA
white	O
and	O
this	O
line	O
up	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
just	O
because	O
it's	O

in	O
between	COMMA
ah	COMMA
the	O
line	O

yes	COMMA
no	COMMA
trying	O
