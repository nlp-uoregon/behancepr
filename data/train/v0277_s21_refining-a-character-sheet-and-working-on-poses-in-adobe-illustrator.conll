we	O
consume	O
in	PERIOD
go	O
scrub	O
this	PERIOD
it's	O
ungrouped	O
this	O
character	PERIOD
alright	PERIOD
so	COMMA
we'll	O
color	O
in	O
that	O
hair	PERIOD
coloring	O
the	O
legs	PERIOD
just	O
like	O
that	PERIOD
and	COMMA
so	COMMA
now	COMMA
we	O
have	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
new	O
from	O
our	O
original	O
sketch	O
of	O
the	O
character	O
to	O
this	O
one	PERIOD
and	COMMA
those	O
things	O
are	O
the	O
strokes	PERIOD
now	COMMA
will	O
become	O
the	O
shapes	O
of	O
our	O
eyes	PERIOD
we	O
don't	O
want	O
that	O
white	O
ville	COMMA
so	O
I'm	O

want	O
the	O
eyes	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
skinny	PERIOD
they're	O
not	O
that	O
noticeable	COMMA
so	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
bump	O
them	O
up	O
to	O
about	O
three	O
points	PERIOD
make	O
sure	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
rounded	O
cap	COMMA
so	O
they	O
stay	O
nice	O
and	O
soft	O
rather	O
than	O
a	O
butt	O
cap	O
just	COMMA
just	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
abrupt	O
than	O
I	O
want	O
for	O
the	O
style	O
of	O
this	O
character	PERIOD
and	COMMA
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
actually	O
make	O
those	O
strokes	O
that	O
blue	O
color	PERIOD
you'll	O
see	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
first	O
collect	O
it	PERIOD
it's	O
going	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
fill	COMMA
that	O
color	PERIOD
I	O
can	O
flip	O
that	O
and	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
reapply	O
my	O
strokes	O
color	COMMA
or	O
reapplied	O
the	O
thickness	COMMA
and	O
in	O
fact	COMMA
that	O
might	O
be	O
too	O
heavy	O
for	O
the	O
eyes	O
is	O
red	O
it	O
too	PERIOD
so	COMMA
yeah	PERIOD
so	COMMA
two	O
pixels	O
works	O
for	O
that	COMMA
and	O
then	COMMA
the	O
same	O
thing	O
here	COMMA
I	O
need	O
to	O
probably	O
make	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
the	O
mouth	PERIOD
this	O
color	COMMA
or	O
maybe	O
even	O
the	O
darker	O
color	COMMA
and	O
then	COMMA
the	O
tongue	O
probably	O
just	O
be	O
this	O
red	O
color	PERIOD
I'm	O
gonna	O
nudge	O
it	O
ever	O
so	O
slightly	COMMA
so	O
we	O
don't	O
see	O
any	O
of	O
that	O
line	PERIOD
there	O
we	O
go	PERIOD
ok	PERIOD
so	COMMA
again	COMMA
you	O
can	O
kind	O
of	O
see	O
the	O
difference	O
here	O
between	O
the	O
character	O
that	O
has	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
volume	O
to	O
it	O
and	O
the	O
one	O
that	O
does	O
not	PERIOD
I'm	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
recolor	O
this	O
wing	O
with	O
these	O
highlights	COMMA
instead	COMMA
what	O
i'll	O
do	O
is	O
just	O
copy	O
this	O
one	O
over	PERIOD
once	O
i've	O
grouped	O
those	COMMA
those	O
pieces	O
now	COMMA
we	O
can	O
copy	O
it	PERIOD
will	O
just	O
rotate	O
this	O
into	O
roughly	O
the	O
same	O
position	COMMA
and	O
we	O
can	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
the	O

ones	PERIOD
so	COMMA
we've	O
already	O
