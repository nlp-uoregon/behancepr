ok	PERIOD
so	COMMA
now	O
I	O
have	O
a	O

the	O

that	O
I	O
sketched	O
out	PERIOD
the	O

then	COMMA
I'm	O
going	O
to	PERIOD
alright	COMMA
you	O
first	PERIOD
first	COMMA
let's	O
get	O
a	O
thicker	O
stroke	PERIOD
probably	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
about	O
50	O
pixels	O
and	O
then	COMMA
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
switch	O
from	O
the	COMMA
from	O
the	O
selection	O

to	O
the	O
direct	O

so	COMMA
i'll	O
hit	O
a	O

to	O
select	O
that	PERIOD
and	COMMA
you'll	O
see	O
that	O
there	O

me	O
that	O
I	O
have	O

if	O
I	O
just	O
pull	O
this	O

go	O
for	O
rounded	O
corners	COMMA
instantly	O
I	O
get	O
that	O
rounded	COMMA
uh	COMMA
instead	O
of	O
rounded	O
strokes	PERIOD

I	O
can	O
see	O
now	O
that	O
I	O

a	O

better	O
match	O
my	COMMA
my	O
original	O

I'm	O
going	O

to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
as	O

as	O
they	O
can	O

so	COMMA
now	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
rounded	O
stroke	O
that	O
is	O
really	O
mimicking	O
the	O
sketch	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
originally	O
which	O
is	O
fantastic	PERIOD
the	O
next	O
thing	COMMA
that	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
do	O

is	O
to	O
convert	O
this	O
from	O
being	O
a	O
stroke	O
to	O
a	O
shape	PERIOD
and	COMMA
so	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
do	O
that	COMMA
is	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
object	COMMA
path	O
outline	O
stroke	PERIOD
and	COMMA
you'll	O
see	O
then	O
that	O
what	O
I	O
have	COMMA
we	O
ungroup	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
stroke	O
that	O
is	O
left	O
behind	O
which	O
I	O
no	O
longer	O
want	PERIOD
so	COMMA
we're	O
going	O
to	O
delete	O
that	COMMA
but	O
I'm	O
left	O
with	O
the	O
shape	PERIOD
and	COMMA
I	O
can	O
swap	O
the	O
outline	O
there	PERIOD
so	COMMA
we're	O
just	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
stroke	PERIOD
let's	O
make	O
the	O
phil	O
white	O
consistency	O

then	COMMA
we'll	O
move	O
that	O
back	O

that	PERIOD
mot	O
says	O
inside	O

the	O

yes	COMMA
all	O
right	PERIOD
here	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
copy	O

then	COMMA
just	O
cut	O
out	O
that	O
extra	O
little	O
piece	O

then	COMMA
we	O
can	O
move	O
up	O

so	COMMA
I'm	O
going	O
