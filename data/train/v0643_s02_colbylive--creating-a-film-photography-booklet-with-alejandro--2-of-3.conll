following	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
what	O
are	O
you	O
doing	O
something	O
all	O
those	O
analog	O
photography	O
I	O
know	O
it's	O
really	O
cool	O
to	O
see	O
it	O
especially	O
when	O
we	O
look	O
into	O
look	O
at	O
like	O
the	O
variety	O
of	O
cameras	O
use	O
oh	O
yeah	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
you	O
got	O
one	O
of	O
your	O
cameras	O
I	O
brought	O
nice	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
chose	O
to	O
do	O
we	O
don't	O
also	O
in	O
the	O
chat	O
keep	O
in	O
mind	O
too	O
that	O
the	O
chats	O
usually	O
delayed	O
by	O
like	O
30	O
seconds	O
in	O
it	O
so	O
it	O
takes	O
me	O
seconds	O
respond	O
that's	O
probably	O
why	O
so	O
yeah	O
I	O
just	O
wanna	O
get	O
up	O
close	O
to	O
my	O
canon	O
ae1	O
program	O
it's	O
leica	O
sl	O
are	O
like	O
a	O
basic	O
slr	O
camera	O
and	O
then	O
for	O
my	O
square	O
format	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
lumia	O
c3	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
twin	O
lens	O
reflex	O
camera	O
to	O
hold	O
it	O
like	O
even	O
close	O
it	O
sounds	O
like	O
so	O
cool	O
that	O
is	O
like	O
nice	O
build	O
like	O
see	O
the	O
detail	O
yeah	O
and	O
it's	O
it's	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
cameras	O
that	O
you	O
just	O
look	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
the	O
first	O
lens	O
you	O
look	O
through	O
the	O
2nd	O
lens	O
is	O
the	O
one	O
that	O
actually	O
takes	O
the	O
photo	O
so	O
with	O
these	O
squared	O
format	O
ones	O
which	O
ones	O
are	O
these	O
being	O
taken	O
with	O
this	O
cool	O
yeah	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
like	O
rectangle	O
ones	O
are	O
just	O
by	O
35	O
millimeter	O
awesome	O
and	O
then	O
yeah	O
so	O
when	O
it	O
switches	O
between	O
black	O
and	O
white	O
and	O
color	O
that's	O
all	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
film	O
that	O
you're	O
using	O
in	O
this	O
camera	O
yeah	O
yeah	O
cool	O
just	O
depends	O
on	O
what	O
type	O
of	O
feeling	O
I'm	O
going	O
for	O
that	O
morning	O
yeah	O
and	O
what	O
type	O
of	O
film	O
you	O
got	O
in	O
your	O
pocket	O
right	O
and	O
michelle	O
and	O
any	O
arguments	O
emojis	O
too	O
so	O
it's	O
cool	O
like	O
that	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
show	O
off	O
his	O
cameras	O
and	O
stuff	O
because	O
it's	O
really	O
like	O
a	O
cool	O
side	O
of	O
photography	O
that	O
you	O
don't	O
normally	O
see	O
yeah	O
especially	O
nowadays	O
but	O
everyone	O
uses	O
cell	O
phones	O
yeah	O
exactly	O
yeah	O
so	O
yeah	O
that's	O
cool	O
actually	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
last	O
place	O
we	O
got	O
right	O
there	O
so	O
we	O
can	O
also	O
think	O
about	O
like	O
if	O
there's	O
a	O
certain	O
photo	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
end	O
it	O
on	O
impact	O
one	O
or	O
something	O
I	O
wonder	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
one	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
like	O
blow	O
up	O
on	O
my	O
both	O
spreads	O
but	O
it	O
be	O
kind	O
of	O
weird	O
'cause	O
you	O
get	O
lost	O
in	O
the	O
gutter	O
that's	O
what	O
I	O
thought	O
too	O
'cause	O
i've	O
always	O
seen	O
like	O
other	O
photographers	O
that	O
I	O
follow	O
do	O
like	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
like	O
it	O
goes	O
from	O
one	O
half	O
and	O
then	O
goes	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
half	O
yeah	O
and	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
oh	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
interesting	O
but	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
interesting	O
to	O
try	O
being	O
issaquah	O
due	O
to	O
have	O
like	O
1	O
big	O
splash	O
photo	O
yeah	O
so	O
go	O
play	O
with	O
that	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
actually	O
look	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
like	O
it	O
effects	O
everything	O
michelle	O
saying	O
I	O
love	O
those	O
old	O
cameras	O
thank	O
you	O
thank	O
you	O
if	O
I	O
repeat	O
the	O
chat	O
because	O
that	O
doesn't	O
get	O
saved	O
so	O
it's	O
nice	O
to	O
know	O
you're	O
going	O
to	O
repeat	O
that	O
but	O
let	O
me	O
exit	O
out	O
that	O
preview	O
mode	O
so	O
those	O
are	O
the	O
photos	O
ever	O
use	O
it	O
in	O
there	O
nice	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
end	O
up	O
having	O
like	O
49	O
pages	O
but	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
change	O
from	O
most	O
part	O
so	O
just	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
make	O
our	O
lives	O
a	O
little	O
easier	O
I'm	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
delete	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
these	O
extra	O
ones	O
and	O
so	O
let	O
me	O
make	O
sure	O
you	O
got	O
what	O
I	O
need	O
so	O
up	O
here	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
cover	O
page	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
also	O
want	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
the	O
cover	O
usually	O
doesn't	O
have	O
like	O
text	O
'cause	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
add	O
the	O
coupling	O
photo	O
there	O
so	O
by	O
doing	O
that	O
I'm	O
realizing	O
that's	O
going	O
to	O
throw	O
off	O
the	O
order	O
that	O
we	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
looked	O
at	O
so	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
the	O
ones	O
that	O
are	O
side-by-side	O
actually	O
makes	O
sense	O
and	O
then	O
you'll	O
think	O
i've	O
never	O
used	O
them	O
but	O
it's	O
so	O
interesting	O
if	O
it	O
really	O
is	O
should	O
get	O
started	O
into	O
it	O
yeah	O
give	O
me	O
would	O
like	O
recommendations	O
like	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
started	O
or	O
like	O
a	O
device	O
it's	O
honestly	O
just	O
trial	O
and	O
error	O
yeah	O
I'm	O
just	O
playing	O
around	O
with	O
it	O
and	O
just	O
like	O
not	O
being	O
too	O
serious	O
at	O
1st	O
and	O
just	O
go	O
in	O
and	O
then	O
just	O
trying	O
to	O
take	O
some	O
cool	O
photos	O
yeah	O
you	O
know	O
that's	O
how	O
I	O
learn	O
just	O
like	O
playing	O
around	O
and	O
just	O
experimenting	O
see	O
what	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
is	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
see	O
what	O
looks	O
good	O
see	O
what	O
doesn't	O
look	O
good	O
and	O
yeah	O
no	O
definitely	O
it's	O
very	O
tricky	O
also	O
like	O
meter	O
and	O
stuff	O
too	O
when	O
you	O
can't	O
see	O
like	O
the	O
photos	O
you	O
take	O
rats	O
or	O
you	O
take	O
them	O
so	O
have	O
a	O
few	O
and	O
definitely	O
should	O
dust	O
them	O
off	O
and	O
use	O
them	O
again	O
yeah	O
yeah	O
yeah	O
be	O
cool	O
but	O
she	O
also	O
asked	O
how	O
expensive	O
is	O
film	O
these	O
days	O
it	O
just	O
depends	O
it	O
there's	O
more	O
like	O
there's	O
a	O
different	O
variety	O
of	O
different	O
films	O
and	O
there's	O
consumer	O
films	O
which	O
are	O
a	O
lot	O
cheaper	O
you	O
can	O
give	O
them	O
out	O
like	O
walgreens	O
or	O
like	O
walmart	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
also	O
have	O
the	O
professional	O
film	O
those	O
go	O
or	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
expensive	O
they	O
usually	O
range	O
from	O
like	O
around	O
like	O
8	O
to	O
12	O
bucks	O
a	O
roll	O
how	O
many	O
photos	O
parole	O
36	O
so	O
you	O
have	O
36	O
exposures	O
parole	O
but	O
the	O
consumer	O
ones	O
I	O
think	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
like	O
a	O
pack	O
of	O
three	O
for	O
like	O
20	O
bucks	O
so	O
that's	O
a	O
really	O
nice	O
one	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
and	O
experiment	O
with	O
so	O
yeah	O
and	O
michelle's	O
making	O
films	O
not	O
cheap	O
but	O
developing	O
developing	O
is	O
also	O
something	O
to	O
take	O
into	O
account	O
it	O
is	O
and	O
I	O
luckily	O
I	O
developed	O
my	O
own	O
film	O
at	O
home	O
