the	O
only	O
downside	O
to	O
that	O
is	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
doesn't	O
work	O
perfectly	O
I	O
have	O
are	O
paman	O
I	O
don't	O
use	O
it	O
sadly	O
some	O
people	O
love	O
it	O
I	O
know	O
some	O
artists	O
that	O
use	O
it	O
and	O
seem	O
to	O
really	O
like	O
it	O
but	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
for	O
me	O
it's	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
laggy	O
so	O
I	O
prefer	O
to	O
just	O
turn	O
the	O
brush	O
tip	O
myself	O
if	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
different	O
direction	O
ah	O
thank	O
you	O
pablo's	O
was	O
very	O
kind	O
of	O
you	O
there's	O
also	O
a	O
link	O
below	O
the	O
stream	O
description	O
to	O
the	O
to	O
the	O
ghibli	O
brushes	O
the	O
ghibli	O
inspired	O
brushes	O
that	O
I	O
made	O
I	O
might	O
use	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
this	O
painting	O
'cause	O
it	O
seems	O
the	O
right	O
aesthetic	O
here	O
jackson	O
says	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
photoshop	O
cc	O
20	O
or	O
even	O
19	O
not	O
sure	O
you	O
can	O
use	O
the	O
arrow	O
keys	O
to	O
change	O
the	O
angle	O
shift	O
plus	O
arrow's	O
to	O
change	O
in	O
steps	O
oh	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
talk	O
about	O
this	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
you	O
probably	O
already	O
told	O
me	O
about	O
this	O
jackson	O
yeah	O
exactly	O
are	O
that's	O
definitely	O
something	O
that	O
I	O
miss	O
i've	O
kind	O
of	O
come	O
to	O
terms	O
with	O
it	O
but	O
the	O
technology	O
is	O
improving	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
so	O
I'm	O
hoping	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
years	O
things	O
will	O
be	O
closer	O
like	O
that	O
22	O
mimicking	O
traditional	O
I	O
mean	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
what's	O
going	O
on	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
textures	O
and	O
fresco	O
the	O
watercolor	O
textures	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
there's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
stuff	O
that's	O
really	O
pushing	O
to	O
get	O
more	O
traditional	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
will	O
happen	O
alright	O
I'm	O
gonna	O
choose	O
a	O
airbrush	O
for	O
my	O
racer	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
make	O
these	O
hard	O
edged	O
brush	O
strokes	O
for	O
the	O
stairway	O
like	O
this	O
and	O
then	O
erase	O
out	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
for	O
a	O
more	O
subtle	O
fade	O
into	O
the	O
light	O
I'm	O
not	O
being	O
too	O
concerned	O
with	O
making	O
the	O
stairs	O
exactly	O
as	O
they	O
are	O
luckily	O
these	O
stairs	O
are	O
very	O
um	O
organic	O
like	O
there	O
they	O
they've	O
been	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
maybe	O
disrupted	O
by	O
tree	O
roots	O
and	O
things	O
they're	O
kind	O
of	O
bumpy	O
and	O
yeah	O
they're	O
very	O
cozy	O
it's	O
like	O
little	O
cobblestone	O
kind	O
of	O
feeling	O
yep	O
that's	O
true	O
we	O
are	O
it's	O
really	O
true	O
before	O
I	O
merge	O
this	O
down	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
selection	O
of	O
the	O
the	O
colour	O
here	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
add	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
of	O
like	O
a	O
warm	O
glow	O
yeah	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
emerge	O
that	O
down	O
actually	O
no	O
it	O
one	O
more	O
thing	O
so	O
we're	O
getting	O
there	O
we're	O
getting	O
more	O
precise	O
with	O
things	O
oh	O
I	O
started	O
talking	O
about	O
this	O
earlier	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
got	O
distracted	O
in	O
the	O
background	O
there's	O
some	O
more	O
distant	O
foliage	O
and	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
darker	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
think	O
we	O
should	O
paint	O
it	O
in	O
that	O
way	O
because	O
it	O
allows	O
the	O
bright	O
green	O
leaves	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
really	O
stand	O
out	O
nonuniform	O
yeah	O
wonky	O
stairs	O
it's	O
too	O
hard	O
advantage	O
this	O
time	O
but	O
the	O
stairs	O
are	O
not	O
perfect	O
'cause	O
we	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
worry	O
all	O
that	O
much	O
we've	O
got	O
light	O
coming	O
through	O
back	O
here	O
and	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
random	O
little	O
