I	O
just	O
stuck	O
with	O
that	PERIOD
yeah	COMMA
that	O
makes	O
sense	PERIOD
and	O
now	COMMA
he	O
said	O
so	COMMA
I	O
kind	O
of	O
see	O
some	O
spotlights	O
and	O
stuff	O
in	O
the	O
background	PERIOD
and	O
that	COMMA
yeah	COMMA
ok	COMMA
that	O
makes	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
sense	O
'cause	O
wondering	O
how	O
you're	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
this	O
popup	O
'cause	O
I'm	O
just	O
working	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
is	O
really	O
difficult	PERIOD
so	COMMA
yeah	PERIOD
for	O
film	COMMA
for	O
sure	COMMA
yeah	PERIOD
so	COMMA
you	O
have	O
to	O
really	O
like	O
know	O
where	O
your	O
light	O
sources	O
are	O
and	O
then	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
read	O
the	O
light	O
as	O
it	O
is	PERIOD
and	O
then	COMMA
you	O
probably	O
have	O
to	O
also	O
think	O
about	O
like	O
how	O
long	O
your	O
exposure	O
is	O
to	PERIOD
do	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
just	O
give	O
us	O
a	O
quick	O
breakdown	O
of	O
like	O
the	O
exposure	O
versus	O
like	O
shutter	O
speed	O
and	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
what	O
those	O
mean	PERIOD
we	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
detail	O
about	O
how	COMMA
peter	PERIOD
so	COMMA
aperture	O
and	O
shutter	O
speed	COMMA
they	O
go	O
in	O
hand	O
with	O
each	O
other	PERIOD
the	O
aperture	O
is	O
the	O
ring	O
that	O
goes	O
on	O
the	O
lens	PERIOD
you	O
want	O
to	O
hold	O
this	O
up	COMMA
maybe	O
you	O
can	O
show	O
us	PERIOD
well	COMMA
this	O
right	O
here	O
is	O
the	O
aperture	COMMA
it's	O
the	O
aperture	O
ring	O
right	O
there	O
so	O
that	O
basically	O
in	O
the	O
lens	O
that	O
has	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
like	O
hole	PERIOD
in	COMMA
the	O
bigger	O
the	O
aperture	COMMA
the	O
bigger	O
the	O
hole	PERIOD
and	O
then	COMMA
the	O
smaller	O
the	O
aperture	COMMA
smaller	O
holes	PERIOD
so	COMMA
because	PERIOD
the	O
whole	O
is	O
letting	O
in	O
and	O
out	O
like	PERIOD
yeah	COMMA
the	O
whole	O
basically	O
let's	O
in	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
light	PERIOD
and	O
then	COMMA
you	O
also	O
have	O
your	O
shutter	O
speed	O
which	O
also	O
goes	O
really	O
well	O
with	O
your	O
apertures	O
so	O
that	COMMA
that	O
basically	O
indicates	O
how	O
fast	O
the	O
shutter	O
needs	O
to	O
open	O
and	O
close	PERIOD
so	COMMA
if	O
you	O
have	O
like	O
a	O
lower	O
shutter	O
speed	COMMA
the	O
aperture	O
will	O
stay	O
open	O
longer	O
and	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
higher	O
shutter	O
speed	COMMA
aperture	O
will	O
stay	O
open	O
like	O
less	PERIOD
so	COMMA
what's	O
the	O
benefit	O
to	O
having	O
a	O
longer	O
shutter	O
speed	O
for	O
example	QUESTION
so	COMMA
longer	O
service	O
speed	O
will	O
basically	O
give	O
you	O
like	O
a	O
larger	O
window	O
of	O
light	PERIOD
so	O
basically	COMMA
so	O
a	O
longer	O
shutter	O
speed	O
will	O
let	O
in	O
more	O
light	PERIOD
so	COMMA
I	O
hope	O
I'm	O
explaining	O
that	O
really	PERIOD
don't	COMMA
know	PERIOD
you've	O
got	O
explains	PERIOD
know	COMMA
it's	O
tough	PERIOD
