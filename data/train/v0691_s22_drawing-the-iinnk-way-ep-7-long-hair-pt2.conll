of	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
fairies	O
that	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
so	O
that	O
people	O
will	O
see	O
what	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
can	O
come	O
and	O
ask	O
me	O
for	O
what	O
they	O
actually	O
want	O
you	O
know	O
while	O
I'm	O
doing	O
what	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
so	O
like	O
in	O
my	O
spare	O
time	O
like	O
stuff	O
like	O
this	O
right	O
now	O
I	O
post	O
what	O
I	O
want	O
people	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
tattooing	O
all	O
of	O
those	O
designs	O
and	O
stuff	O
that	O
I	O
show	O
you	O
where	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
people	O
to	O
see	O
you	O
know	O
because	O
they	O
may	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
it	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
that	O
don't	O
know	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
portraits	O
they	O
don't	O
know	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
this	O
now	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
that	O
and	O
they	O
literally	O
blown	O
away	O
when	O
they	O
find	O
out	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
something	O
this	O
like	O
why	O
would	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
I	O
couldn't	O
do	O
it	O
just	O
like	O
well	O
i've	O
never	O
seen	O
you	O
do	O
it	O
and	O
it's	O
like	O
holy	O
crap	O
you're	O
right	O
i've	O
never	O
actually	O
put	O
it	O
out	O
there	O
because	O
i've	O
never	O
actually	O
put	O
it	O
out	O
there	O
who	O
could	O
potentially	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
actually	O
do	O
it	O
so	O
that	O
started	O
my	O
whole	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
just	O
draw	O
a	O
whole	O
bunch	O
of	O
stuff	O
showing	O
what	O
I	O
actually	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
'cause	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
really	O
really	O
big	O
tattoos	O
and	O
that	O
take	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
to	O
do	O
and	O
cover	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
space	O
but	O
again	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
good	O
enough	O
to	O
get	O
people	O
to	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
that	O
much	O
skin	O
because	O
no	O
one	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
just	O
be	O
like	O
hey	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
half	O
my	O
body	O
or	O
a	O
whole	O
limb	O
on	O
my	O
body	O
to	O
tattoo	O
if	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
you	O
can	O
actually	O
do	O
it	O
like	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
are	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
I'm	O
not	O
doing	O
that	O
like	O
I	O
you're	O
good	O
and	O
everything	O
but	O
like	O
I	O
don't	O
trust	O
you	O
like	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
show	O
me	O
and	O
as	O
upsetting	O
as	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
or	O
as	O
insulting	O
as	O
you	O
might	O
feel	O
by	O
it	O
or	O
whatever	O
is	O
like	O
is	O
would	O
you	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
would	O
you	O
allow	O
somebody	O
to	O
tattoo	O
on	O
you	O
and	O
do	O
whatever	O
they	O
want	O
without	O
knowing	O
if	O
they	O
can	O
do	O
it	O
course	O
not	O
so	O
why	O
would	O
you	O
expect	O
someone	O
else	O
to	O
let	O
you	O
do	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
but	O
as	O
a	O
tattoo	O
artist	O
you	O
think	O
like	O
that	O
your	O
ego	O
completely	O
gets	O
ahold	O
of	O
you	O
and	O
you	O
just	O
like	O
well	O
I	O
will	O
let	O
me	O
do	O
it	O
because	O
I	O
me	O
and	O
I'm	O
I'm	O
dope	O
I	O
can	O
do	O
anything	O
and	O
it's	O
like	O
nah	O
it	O
doesn't	O
work	O
like	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
now	O
did	O
you	O
get	O
to	O
a	O
point	O
where	O
you	O
just	O
get	O
you	O
get	O
so	O
relaxed	O
and	O
what	O
you're	O
doing	O
that	O
nothing	O
can	O
bother	O
you	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
like	O
everything	O
you	O
do	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
I	O
instead	O
of	O
me	O
instead	O
of	O
me	O
sending	O
up	O
watching	O
tv	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
on	O
my	O
days	O
off	O
'cause	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
all	O
my	O
work	O
a	O
regular	O
job	O
I	O
work	O
I	O
make	O
coins	O
five	O
days	O
a	O
week	O
for	O
12	O
hours	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
I	O
took	O
that	O
regular	O
job	O
when	O
the	O
whole	O
covid-19	O
thing	O
hit	O
this	O
tattooing	O
just	O
went	O
dead	O
tattooing	O
was	O
just	O
nonexistent	O
so	O
I	O
did	O
I	O
did	O
the	O
whole	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
work	O
thing	O
'cause	O
tattooing	O
die	O
but	O
once	O
once	O
everything	O
kind	O
of	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
normal	O
I	O
didn't	O
I	O
didn't	O
necessarily	O
well	O
as	O
normal	O
as	O
it	O
possibly	O
get	O
I	O
didn't	O
want	O
to	O
necessarily	O
quit	O
my	O
job	O
you	O
know	O
because	O
I	O
always	O
felt	O
like	O
well	O
I	O
could	O
I	O
could	O
always	O
use	O
the	O
extra	O
money	O
so	O
I	O
stay	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
do	O
tattooing	O
when	O
I'm	O
off	O
which	O
is	O
cool	O
except	O
for	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
I	O
only	O
use	O
the	O
give	O
out	O
one	O
day	O
to	O
do	O
tattooing	O
so	O
that	O
one	O
day	O
is	O
generally	O
it	O
means	O
that	O
during	O
the	O
week	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
actually	O
find	O
it	O
have	O
to	O
actually	O
find	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
draw	O
up	O
a	O
tattoo	O
and	O
get	O
the	O
stencil	O
ready	O
and	O
send	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
client	O
and	O
get	O
the	O
client's	O
approval	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
that	O
before	O
time	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
tattoo	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
all	O
after	O
work	O
so	O
when	O
I	O
get	O
off	O
work	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
come	O
home	O
and	O
immediately	O
star	O
drawing	O
because	O
normally	O
I	O
would	O
stream	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
but	O
I	O
can't	O
because	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
come	O
home	O
and	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
glad	O
to	O
do	O
planning	O
now	O
once	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
tattoo	O
altogether	O
and	O
everything	O
like	O
that	O
then	O
i'll	O
stream	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
drawing	O
it	O
but	O
the	O
planning	O
process	O
I	O
if	O
I'm	O
streaming	O
I	O
won't	O
get	O
ever	O
get	O
anything	O
done	O
'cause	O
it	O
takes	O
me	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
hours	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
that	O
would	O
only	O
take	O
me	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
minutes	O
if	O
I	O
wasn't	O
streaming	O
so	O
to	O
keep	O
focused	O
I	O
don't	O
stream	O
the	O
the	O
construction	O
of	O
the	O
tattoo	O
with	O
all	O
as	O
only	O
after	O
I	O
figure	O
out	O
what	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
I'm	O
like	O
alright	O
I	O
hop	O
on	O
stream	O
really	O
quick	O
and	O
work	O
on	O
this	O
other	O
stream	O
stuff	O
like	O
this	O
I	O
just	O
do	O
every	O
day	O
this	O
is	O
my	O
warm	O
up	O
stuff	O
for	O
any	O
of	O
you	O
guys	O
that	O
don't	O
necessarily	O
have	O
a	O
warm	O
up	O
regiment	O
I	O
suggest	O
you	O
get	O
one	O
like	O
me	O
out	O
but	O
like	O
I	O
said	O
i've	O
been	O
doing	O
this	O
for	O
for	O
9	O
years	O
now	O
where	O
I	O
just	O
draw	O
something	O
that	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
or	O
something	O
I	O
need	O
practice	O
on	O
every	O
single	O
day	O
